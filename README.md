# msk-framework-terraform

This repository hosts a terraform module for the creation of a base network environment in AWS, on which MSK (Kafka) can be installed.

## Usage
The terraform code hosted in this repository can be easily used by creating a parent module on your local machine, in a main.tf file as shown below.
(More information about terraform modules can be found on [this](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules) page)










Note the `source` parameter can be used to *either* point directly to this repository or a local copy of the terraform module.

The command [`ssh-keygen`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-keygen) can be used to generate a keypair.  The private key should not be shared, and its file location should be the value for `private_key_path`.  The contents of the public key should be given as the value for `public_key_path`

## Cloud Topology
Assuming that defaults were used, the following resources are created by the terraform module:

Users are reminded that the deployment of cloud resources will incur costs.

 - 1 VPC, with a CIDR Range of 10.0.0.0/16
 - 3 Subnets, distributed evenly across 3 Availability zones, with the following CIDR Ranges:
   - 10.0.1.0/24
   - 10.0.2.0/24
   - 10.0.3.0/24
 - 1, or between 3 and 10 EC2 instances (Depending on whether a single instance, or an autonomous cluster is selected)
 - 1 Network (Layer 4) Load Balancer

## Prerequisites

### Terraform and AWS CLI configuration
In order to use this module, terraform needs to be properly installed and configured.  Whilst this is out of the scope of this README file, an example `provider.tf` file is shown below.  The [official terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) explains how to get terraform up and running on a local machine.  Alternatively, [Terraform Cloud](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cloud-get-started) is another option.

~~~
//Configure the terraform backend (S3) and aws provider
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket  = "<s3-bucketname goes here>"
    key     = "terraform.tfstate"
    region  = "us-east-1"
  }

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
    }
  }
}

//Specify which AWS region and profile should be used by default
provider "aws" {
  region  = "us-east-1"
}
~~~

### AWS Permisions

As part of this implementation, an IAM role is created for the EC2 instances which allows them to 'tag' the Network Load Balancer with the current version of neo4j.  This functionality has been put in place as part of future development plans to ensure that any new nodes which are added to the cluster install the same version of Neo4j as the existing instances.   Users will therefore need to ensure that their AWS account has sufficient permissions to be able to perform the following.
 - Create an IAM role
 - Attach the IAM role to EC2 instances
 - Create a policy for the role which includes the following permissions:
     elasticloadbalancing:AddTags
     elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTags
     elasticloadbalancingv2:AddTags
     elasticloadbalancingv2:DescribeTags


The IAM role, policy and permissions are all created within the [iam.tf](iam.tf) file.

The role is attached to the instance by the following entry within the [instances.tf](instances.tf) file:
```  iam_instance_profile = aws_iam_instance_profile.neo4j_instance_profile.name ```

Here is an example line from [neo4j.tftpl](neo4j.tftpl) showing the EC2 instance tagging the load balancer with the current version of neo4j:
``` aws elbv2 add-tags --resource-arns $LB_ARN --tags Key=Neo4j_Built_Version,Value=$(/usr/share/neo4j/bin/neo4j --version) --region=$TARGET_REGION ```


## Limitations

Currently, the following limitations apply:
 - Only Neo4j v5 is supported.  Support for 4.4 will follow.
 - The addition of nodes to a neo4j cluster is currently not supported.  The desired number of nodes in a cluster must be selected prior to deployment, using the node_count variable
 - SSL (https) has not been included in this initial release
 - The environment uses a network load balancer in AWS.  This means the EC2 instances will also be directly accessible from whichever address ranges are configure in var.ssh_source_cidr
